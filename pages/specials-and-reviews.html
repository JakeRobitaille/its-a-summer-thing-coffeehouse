                "What else can I say but 'WOW!' This has to be the best coffee shop that I have ever been to. I love their rotation of seasonal blends and have yet to find one that does not please my palate! 
                The staff is always friendly and welcoming to the customers and will help you find the perfect cup of joe to start your day or end it, sometimes, in my case. 
                The fact that they are accommodating for everyone is a big bonus too. They have many gluten free, vegan, and paleo options amoung much more! If you are in the area and looking for highly reccommended coffee shops look no furthur! 
                'It's A Summer Thing' is the place to be!"

                "It's official, I have a coffee addiction. 'It's A Summer Thing' has been my supplier for around 3 years now.
                Since then; I have lost my wife, my job, and everything that I love, besides coffee. I had to take a second mortgage out on my home.
                All in the name of coffee!"

                There is outdoor seating as well, if you want some fresh air."

                "I went into 'It's A Summer Thing' cafe and they gave me their 'pretend coffee'. Like, they handed me nothing, just air while they cupped their hands as if they were holding a coffee cup! I did not know that the coffee was LITTERALLY pretend!!
                I feel as though they should have made that clearer in the description, but the cashier was very merry about the whole thing and refunded my money. For that I give them 3-stars"
